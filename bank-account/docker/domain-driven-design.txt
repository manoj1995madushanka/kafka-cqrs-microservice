Domain Driven Design (DDD)
• The term "domain-driven design" was coined by Eric Evans in 2003
• An approach to structure and model software in a way that it matches the

business domain
• It places the primary focus of a software project on the core area of the business (the core domain)
• Refers to problems as domains and aims to establish a common language to talk about these problems
• Describes independent problem areas as Bounded Contexts

Bounded Context
    it is an independent problem area
    describes a logical boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable
    each bounded context correlates to a microservice
