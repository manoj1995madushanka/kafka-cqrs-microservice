key considerations of event store

    An event store must be an append only store, no update or delete operations should be allowed
    Each event that is saved should represent the version or state of an aggregate at any given point in time
    Events should be stored in chronological order, and new events should be appended to the previous event
    The state of the aggregate should be repeatable by replaying the event store
    Implement optimistic concurrency control
